# Adopet

Mock website for pet adopting. You can create a adopter account or a shelter account, both with different capabilities.  

This project was made for a alura back-end coding challenge, but I decided to make it  a full-stack one, just to learn more.
  
Most of the designs are heavily spired by the original figma design provided by alura and some assets were also provided, such as  the adopet logo.
